# ExpManager
Exp (Reputation) Management Plugin for MYBB

Extension for MyBB

** Please note!  If you find that the dialogs for submissions are not working, 
you may need to include JQuery UI in your headerincludes template.  

The link for this can be found here - https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/

As of 5/22/2015 the most recent version (1.11.4) works.  This may change as Mybb and jquery versions upgrade!
